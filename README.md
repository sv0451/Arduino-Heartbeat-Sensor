# Arduino-Heartbeat-Sensor
This project uses an Arduino microcontroller and a heartbeat sensor to monitor and display heart rate in real-time. The sensor reads the pulse from the user's fingertip or earlobe, processes the signal, and displays the heart rate in beats per minute (BPM) on a connected LCD screen or serial monitor.
